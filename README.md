  * Contemporary Human Behavior Theory: A Critical Perspective for Social Work Practice takes a multidisciplinary, theoretical approach to HBSE and provides a consistent analytical framework for readers to examine both traditional and contemporary theories. Students are encouraged to develop their critical-thinking skills as they explore each theory and analyze the social, ideological, and economic structures of society that impact individual problems. Each chapter includes coverage of the research that supports a particular theory, an analysis of the validity of that research, and a discussion of contemporary issues.
